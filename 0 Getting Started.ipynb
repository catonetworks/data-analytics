    "API calls are authenticated by an account ID (which is not really secret), an API key (which definitely should be kept secret) and the key's role (Viewer or Editor). Storing the key directly within an API script is a very bad idea, so a common way to make the key available to a script without encoding it inside the script is to create an environment variable in which to hold the key, and then have the script read the key from the environment variable at run time.\n",

If you don't know how to set up and manage environment variables on your platform of choice, now is a good time to learn. If for whatever reason you're unwilling or unable to do this right now, you should uncomment the \"THIS IS A BAD IDEA\" line, and paste your key directly into the notebook."

    "## Making Cato API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cato API is GraphQL with a single URL for all customers, https://api.catonetworks.com/api/v1/graphql2. Each call consists of three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The operation name, which is a single string.\n",
    "* A set of variables, which in Python is usually constructed as a dictionary. For simple calls the dictionary might only have one element; for more complex calls it can be nested to multiple levels.\n",
    "* A query string in GraphQL's \"Looks a bit like JSON but isn't really\" format.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to interpolate the variable values directly into the query string, in which case no separate variables component is required, and for developers who are new to GraphQL, this can look like a simple and attractive option. It is, however, worth learning how to use parameterised queries with separate variables as data analytics usually requires multiple queries, and using parameters makes the job much easier. The three elements are supplied in the POST body, like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\"operationName\":\"operation name string\", \"variables\":{the variable dictionary}, \"query\":\"query string\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The request needs two mandatory headers and one optional header:\n",
    "* The API key is supplied as the value for the x-api-key header.\n",
    "* The Content-Type must be \"application/json\".\n",
    "* The optional header is to enable compression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compression is particularly important when doing data analytics with Cato because Cato data, especially events, tend to be extremely compressible (up to 95%) so enabling compression results in much faster API calls and much less data transferred over the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many Cato customers use the **requests** module to make HTTP calls with Python. For these examples we will instead use the urllib module which ships with Python, to avoid having to install another third party import. There is no reason not to use requests in production, but occasionally we work with customers who are trying to run Python in locked-down and/or headless environments where installing third party modules can be problematic, so it can be useful to know that there is an alternative to fall back on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all of this together, one of the simplest API calls which can be made is accountSnapshot with only the account ID field in the response. This is a useful \"ping\" to check that everything is working, and that we can make API calls with a recognisable output. For this example we will not ask for compression, but for later notebooks where we are using a separate module for making APi calls, compression will always be enabled.\n"
