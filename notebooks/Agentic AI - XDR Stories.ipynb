    "## Agentic AI - XDR Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color: #FFEBCC; border-left: 6px solid #FFA500; padding: 10px;\">\n",
    "<b>Warning:</b>This example requires the use of a third party, commercial LLM (OpenAI) which charges for API use. The XDR incident data being sent to OpenAI can be substantial and will often include sensitive data such as PII. Anyone seeking to build an agent using the process described below should ensure that they are willing to pay the charges associated with use of the LLM, and have approval to send their account data to OpenAI. Alternative models and platforms are available which might be cheaper and/or allow customers to run a model locally.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do we mean by \"Agentic AI\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to ChatGPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that operate autonomously, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals without constant human intervention.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key factors which distinguish an AI Agent from a non-AI agent (such as a reminder email your mobile phone provider sends you when you are running low on credit) and which distinguish it from non-agentic AI (such as a ChatGPT conversation) are:\n",
    "* **Autonomous Decision-Making:** the system can make decisions on unfamiliar data without ongoing explanation and assistance from a human.\n",
    "* **Independent Execution:** the system operates when required without needing a human to activate it. This might be in response to some sort of event trigger, or a regular poll.\n",
    "* **Stimulus/response:** the system receives input from some external factors, and executes actions accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will build a simple agent which manages a Cato Networks customer account's XDR incident feed, by providing analyst feedback for open stories. In order to be able to do this, it will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the Cato API to download a list of stories generated or updated during a certain timeframe.\n",
    "2. Use the OpenAI API to send each story together with a suitable prompt, receiving the model's classification of the incident and recommended settings for fields such as status and verdict.\n",
    "3. Format the model's response as Cato XDR analyst feedback and submit via the Cato API, checking for any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value proposition is clear. Even though the Cato Networks XDR feature provides a low-volume, high-value feed of curated security events, if you are a small IT team, you might not have time to manage your XDR story workbench as often or as diligently as you would like. Even if you have the resources, you might appreciate having a knowledgeable and capable LLM triage the list for you, closing out incidents which do not meet the criteria for involvement by a human analyst. You may even find over time that you place a high degree of trust in the AI's capabilities to make good quality decisions, 24x7x365.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cato Networks XDR\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "XDR (Extended Detection and Response) is a comprehensive cybersecurity approach that integrates and correlates data from multiple security layers to provide enhanced threat detection, investigation, and response capabilities.\n",
    " \n",
    "Cato Networks' XDR platform enables both Security operations and Network operations teams to monitor the organization's network for potential security threats and network performance issues. The platform includes advanced correlation engines (called Producers) that analyze traffic data to find matches for specific indications of threat activities or network issues. When a match is found, it produces a story that can be reviewed and investigated in the Cato Management Application (CMA).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the perfectly acceptable definition I received from the Cato Chatbot. Cato's XDR is a popular feature which adds an additional tier to the value pyramid:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"valuevolume.png\" width=\"600\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of the pyramid are firewall events from Cato's Triple Firewall (Internet/WAN/LAN) which can be up to 90% of a Cato customer's feed. Although these are valuable from a forensic and incident response perspective, when it comes to threat hunting the large volume outweighs the value considerably. Next up are the events produced by Cato security features such as IPS, Anti Malware, CASB, DLP, as well as connectivity events such as ZTNA user connections and CMA logins. These are a much lower volume but much higher value. Finally at the top are the XDR producer models running over everything happening in the bottom tiers, producing a low volume of extremely high value, curated stories. We're going to add a new tier on top of the pyramid, so the human analyst working the list of open stories can focus on those stories which are most worthy of attention, such as incidents where not all activity was blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our goal is to close low-severity stories while adding additional explanatory information to more interesting stories in the XDR workbench in CMA**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialising the connection to the API.\n",
    "Firstly, let's import the libraries we need and set up the connection to the API. As usual, we assuming that the account ID and API key are preloaded as environment variables and we use our helper module to encapsulate the business of making an API call (see the [Getting Started](Getting%20Started.ipynb) notebook if any of this is unclear):"

    "### The XDR Stories Query\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cato Networks API call our agent will use to retrieve XDR stories is the [xdr.stories](https://api.catonetworks.com/documentation/#query-xdr.stories) query, which is documented in the knowledge base. XDR stories are **rich*** objects with multiple levels, many different fields and potentially large arrays of incident and timeseries data. A full explanation of every single field is outside the scope of this document and potentially any document, due to the dynamic nature of XDR in general, and the rate at which Cato introduces new fields and features. This is one of the primary advantages of using an LLM to analyse the story data:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The AI should be able to understand the data without being told exactly what it is.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is possible because the Cato API provides fields which describe what they actually contain; for example, the object which contains the incident data is called, well, **incident**. We do however have to construct a GraphQL query which the agent will use to extract all these fields. When I need to construct a new query, especially where there are many potential fields, a method I've found to be useful is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy the example query and variables from the Cato API documentation: [https://api.catonetworks.com/documentation/#query-xdr.stories](https://api.catonetworks.com/documentation/#query-xdr.stories)\n",
    "2. Paste these into the Cato API Playground: [https://api.catonetworks.com/api/v1/graphql2](https://api.catonetworks.com/api/v1/graphql2)\n",
    "3. Adjust the query, adding fields as suggested by the documentation and according to the online help provided by the Playground.\n",
    "4. Copy the finished query and variables into your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process resulted in the following query and variables:"

    "Now that we have imported our modules and defined the Cato API query for downloading stories, the agent can call this query and store the results in a list of story objects. It needs to do this in a loop because the XDR query is limited by a batch size, and so allows the requester to paginate over multiple iterations to retrieve all eligible stories according to the input parameters. These parameters include a timeframe, and for the purposes of this exercise, we will use a timeframe of 1 day. This implies that the agent will be scheduled to only execute once every 24 hours. For some organisations this is entirely acceptable; others might prefer an agent which runs more frequently, such as once per hour, in which case the timeframe input would need to be aligned with this schedule.\n",

    "### Step 3: Submitting the LLM responses as analyst feedback using the Cato API\n",
    "\n",
    "Our agent will be able to submit feedback, set the severity and threat type and even close XDR incidents using the **analystFeedback** mutation, which is documented here: [https://api.catonetworks.com/documentation/#mutation-xdr.analystFeedback](https://api.catonetworks.com/documentation/#mutation-xdr.analystFeedback). This is a much smaller, simpler call than the XDR stories call the agent used to download the stories. The biggest difficulty we have is in transforming the response from the LLM to fit the Cato API's input parameters, as defined [here](https://api.catonetworks.com/documentation/#definition-AnalystFeedbackInput). However... compare those input parameters with the JSON structure we asked the LLM for in the system prompt, and what do you see... that's right, they are almost the same. By telling the LLM to provide the response using the same fields that the API mutation requires, we have made it very easy for the agent to transform the data from LLM to API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only real change is that instead of using the **additionalInfo** field provided by the LLM, I use instead the **explanation** field we asked it for. I found in testing that the additionalInfo was largely redundant, being very similar to the threatType data. I also thought it would be useful for a human analyst to be able to look at a story in the Cato Management Application and see not only that it has been worked by the LLM, but also see an explanation of why the LLM took the decisions which it did.\n",
    "\n",
    "So all the agent needs to do now is define the query and loop over the saved story analysis results, submitting each one. There is a chance of errors here, if the LLM for whatever reason decided to go off-piste and provide a value for an enum field which isn't part of the enum. We'll print those but otherwise not worry about them too much - all it means is that the story will remain unmodified, so a human analyst will need to take a look at it."

    "### Conclusion ###\n",
    "\n",
    "There you have it, all of the Python code required to create an AI Agent which can use an LLM to triage and manage a Cato customer's XDR story feed. So is it an actual agent? **No, this is not yet an agent.** This is a Jupyter Notebook which is not really suitable for independent execution. As described in the introduction, this is one of the mandatory requirements for something to be called Agentic AI. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what would be required to turn this into an agent? All you'd need to do is copy the code into a single Python script or module, and then have a way of scheduling that code to run 24x7 with no human intervention. Many customers would use a cloud service such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, but it could also be as simple as a cron job running on a Linux VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as coming up with a suitable platform for continuous operation, someone looking to run an agent such as this in a production environment should probably also consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tuning the system prompt to better align the recommendations with the organisation's objectives and risk profile. For example, additional examples could be provided.\n",
    "* As mentioned, Cato XDR stories are very rich objects with potentially thousands of fields. The larger the object, the higher the token count, the more expensive the LLM cost. Removing some of these fields could result in significant savings without decreasing the quality of the model recommendations. For example, it might not be necessary to send all of the IoAs, timeseries values and incident fields. The company might also decide not to send very large stories to the model for analysis, and instead leave these for human analysts.\n",
    "* A way for the Agent to log and report on its actions, to assist with ongoing QA and monitoring."
