# Jupyter Notebooks
Sample code and Jupyter notebooks for analysing Cato data.

## Contents

[Getting Started](https://github.com/catonetworks/data-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/Getting%20Started.ipynb)
* How to read an API key from an environment variable.
* How to make a Cato GraphQL API call.
* The simplest call: reading back the account ID from accountSnapshot().

[Entities, IDs and entityLookup](https://github.com/catonetworks/data-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/Entities%2C%20IDs%20and%20entityLookup.ipynb)
* What are entities.
* The entityLookup query.
* entityLookup pagination.

[Internet Firewall Hit Counter](https://github.com/catonetworks/data-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/Internet%20Firewall%20Hit%20Counter.ipynb)
* An example which uses the policy Internetfirewall query to retrieve a list of Internet Firewall rules, and the events query to fetch the number of events generated by each rule in the last 7 days.
* These are then combined into a Pandas DataFrame and displayed by Gradio as a rudimentary rule hit counter.

[World Map with Sites](https://github.com/catonetworks/data-analytics/blob/main/notebooks/World%20Map%20with%20Sites.ipynb)
* An example which uses the accountSnapshot query to overlap site locations and connectivity status onto a dynamic map of the world.
* The map is generated by Plotly Express, which must be installed in the Python environment.
* The GUI is provided by Gradio, which must be installed in the Python environment.
